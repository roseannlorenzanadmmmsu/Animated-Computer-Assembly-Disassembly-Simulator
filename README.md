## ANIMATED COMPUTER ASSEMBLY-DISASSEMBLY SIMULATOR
  AR Computer Building Simulator is a mobile device application that uses augmented reality technology to guide users through an interactive experience that will teach them about various computer components and how to put them together to build a functional computer. This application was developed in Unity (2021.1.16f1) and works with Android devices that support augemented reality (requires Android 8.1 (API 27) or later). This project was developed for Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University.

## Why create this app?
  In an online class environment, some topics are much harder to teach effectively. One such topic is computer hardware in ITEC 1001 classes. Traditionally, students participate in a computer hardware lab, where they get hands-on experience with computer hardware. Students who take the class online don't have access to the same equipment at home, the experience is replaced with a lecture-style method which cannot provide the same level of engagement.
  
  Students at home may not have access to physical computer hardware, but almost every student has access to a mobile device. Thus, the idea for this app was born. This application seeks to bridge the gap between physical labs and digital lectures to provide an experience as close to the real thing as possible without relying on physical hardware. Additionally, usage of the app can save money for the school by no longer requiring the schools keep computer hardware on campus for the physical labs.
